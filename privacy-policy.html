                <h3>Information We Collect Through Third-Party Services</h3>

                <h4>Firebase Analytics</h4>
                <p>We use Google Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with our app. This helps us improve the app experience. Firebase Analytics may collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Device information</strong>: Device model, operating system version, language settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage data</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Screens viewed and navigation patterns</li>
                            <li>Features used (search, decks, learning modules, Hanja study, grammar rules)</li>
                            <li>Button taps and interactions</li>

                <p>Firebase Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information such as names or email addresses.</p>

                <h4>Firebase Crashlytics</h4>
                <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to identify and fix app crashes and technical issues. When the app crashes, Crashlytics collects:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong>: Installation UUID (anonymous identifier specific to your app installation)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Crash reports help us maintain app stability and fix bugs quickly.</p>

                <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
                <p>When you make in-app purchases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purchase transactions</strong>: Processed entirely through Apple's App Store</li>
                    <li><strong>Purchase verification</strong>: We verify your purchase status through Apple's StoreKit to enable premium features</li>
                    <li><strong>No payment information</strong>: We never receive or store your payment information (credit card, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
